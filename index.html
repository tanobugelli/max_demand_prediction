    <p>Electrical power generation has been a hot topic in the Maltese Islands over the last years, predominantly during the summer seasons which have been highly charac- terised by successive heat waves, each one seemingly worse than the last. Amidst these heatwaves, it has become a com- mon occurrence for thousands of households and businesses to experience power cuts [1]. The increasingly intensive heat has undoubtedly made appliances such as air-conditioners an increasing necessity in households. The intense weather, paired with an ever-booming economy [2] and an "unprece- dented" growth in population over the last 13 years [3], leads one to question "Can we predict the maximum demand for the country?" To answer this question, the following analysis aims to produce models which can help predict the maximum power demand in Malta, based on environmental and eco- nomic factors.</p>
